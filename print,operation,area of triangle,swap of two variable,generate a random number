1. Write a Python program to print "Hello Python"?
2. Write a Python program to do arithmetical operations addition and division.?
3. Write a Python program to find the area of a triangle?
4. Write a Python program to swap two variables?
5. Write a Python program to generate a random number?

answwers-
Certainly! Here are Python programs to fulfill each of the given tasks:

1. Python program to print "Hello Python":
```python
print("Hello Python")
```

2. Python program to perform addition and division:
```python
num1 = 10
num2 = 5

addition = num1 + num2
division = num1 / num2

print("Addition:", addition)
print("Division:", division)
```

3. Python program to find the area of a triangle:
```python
base = 10
height = 5

area = 0.5 * base * height

print("Area of the triangle:", area)
```

4. Python program to swap two variables:
```python
a = 10
b = 20

print("Before swapping: a =", a, "b =", b)

temp = a
a = b
b = temp

print("After swapping: a =", a, "b =", b)
```

5. Python program to generate a random number:
```python
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)

print("Random number:", random_number)
```

In the last program, we import the `random` module, which provides functions for generating random numbers. 
The `randint()` function is used to generate a random integer within a specified range. 
In this example, we generate a random number between 1 and 100 and assign it to the `random_number` variable. Finally, we print the generated random number.
